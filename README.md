# employee-portal
information of employees
Overview:
I am making simple application “Employees Portal” to list all the necessary information of employees.  In the place I work, whenever I ask to supervisor information about myself, he has to go to Human Resources to get it. I want to make it simple to give access to the supervisor or manager of the department to view the information.

Features:
Employee List : It will list all the information of employees.
User Login: There will be two types of users. Authorized user, who can access and edit the contents. And, unauthorized user, who can only access the contents.
Search: Users will be able to search the information.
Edit/Add/Delete: Authorized users can access and edit/add/delete the contents.

Technologies: For this application, I an planning to use the following languages and technologies:
•	Java
•	IntelliJ
•	myPhpAdmin
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	Bootstrap
Through this project, I will be learning lots of more new coding and syntax. I am not sure if I have to use bootstrap for this project, but I have listed on my technologies list. I will try to give nice look to my project with bootstrap.
